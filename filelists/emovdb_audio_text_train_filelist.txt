/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0556.wav|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0531.wav|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0551.wav|All an appearance can know is mirage.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_137-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_137-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0549.wav|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0514.wav|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0532.wav|May drought destroy your crops.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0547.wav|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0530.wav|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0538.wav|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0541.wav|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0536.wav|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0506.wav|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0517.wav|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0518.wav|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0557.wav|The last refugee had passed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0543.wav|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0523.wav|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0560.wav|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0529.wav|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0544.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0522.wav|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_137-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0510.wav|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0548.wav|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.

/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0553.wav|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0414.wav|Now our figuring was all right.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0534.wav|But Johannes could, and did.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0508.wav|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0519.wav|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0511.wav|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0515.wav|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.

/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.

/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.

/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.

/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.

/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0535.wav|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0378.wav|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.

/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0405.wav|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_137-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0533.wav|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0545.wav|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0507.wav|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0540.wav|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0439.wav|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0555.wav|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0666.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0484.wav|No-sir-ee.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0330.wav|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0386.wav|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0473.wav|The night was calm and snowy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0206.wav|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0465.wav|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0412.wav|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0501.wav|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0554.wav|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0509.wav|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0363.wav|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0340.wav|It was like the beating of hoofs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0196.wav|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0325.wav|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0336.wav|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0488.wav|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0128.wav|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_16-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0469.wav|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0219.wav|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0505.wav|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0426.wav|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_46-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0370.wav|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0137.wav|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0471.wav|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0495.wav|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0230.wav|Do you know any good land around here.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0558.wav|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0065.wav|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0479.wav|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0193.wav|It was edged with ice.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0188.wav|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0332.wav|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0408.wav|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0367.wav|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0018.wav|There was a change now.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0550.wav|This also became part of the daily schedule.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0435.wav|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0168.wav|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0126.wav|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0070.wav|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0396.wav|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0503.wav|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0379.wav|How old are you, daddy.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0427.wav|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0275.wav|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0464.wav|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0198.wav|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0185.wav|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0474.wav|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0100.wav|You must sleep, he urged.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0281.wav|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0446.wav|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0466.wav|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0455.wav|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0521.wav|Without them he could not run his empire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0376.wav|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0449.wav|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0117.wav|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0328.wav|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0335.wav|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0132.wav|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0009.wav|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0374.wav|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0468.wav|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0272.wav|You can take a vacation on pay.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0317.wav|He was a wise hyena.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0411.wav|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0233.wav|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0032.wav|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0205.wav|From now on we're pals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0447.wav|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0520.wav|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0460.wav|I had forgotten their existence.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0320.wav|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0395.wav|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0078.wav|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0155.wav|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0428.wav|It was not exactly a deportation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0148.wav|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0095.wav|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0382.wav|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0242.wav|I saw it when she rolled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0404.wav|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0229.wav|The last one I knew was an overseer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0252.wav|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0212.wav|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0403.wav|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0203.wav|They were following the shore of a lake.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0454.wav|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0441.wav|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0489.wav|They were artists, not biologists.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0036.wav|She turned in at the hotel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0401.wav|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0296.wav|Bassett was a fastidious man.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0138.wav|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0323.wav|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0407.wav|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_365-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0346.wav|Get down and dig in.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0385.wav|That's what Carnegie did.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0310.wav|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0227.wav|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0493.wav|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0291.wav|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0339.wav|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0176.wav|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_197-224_0204.wav|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0413.wav|But I am at the end of my resources.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0444.wav|Then you don't believe in altruism.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_196-224_0200.wav|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0316.wav|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0516.wav|Also, there was awe in their faces.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0238.wav|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0458.wav|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0365.wav|These rumors may even originate with us.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0482.wav|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0559.wav|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0195.wav|But a strange thing happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0381.wav|My name's Ferguson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0292.wav|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0456.wav|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0478.wav|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0309.wav|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0055.wav|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0139.wav|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0360.wav|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_27-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0160.wav|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0394.wav|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0172.wav|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_1-15_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0383.wav|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0387.wav|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0333.wav|This is no place for you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_281-308_0290.wav|One by one the boys were captured.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0313.wav|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0347.wav|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0307.wav|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_57-84_0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0311.wav|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0502.wav|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0167.wav|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0417.wav|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0486.wav|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0005.wav|Will we ever forget it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0337.wav|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0498.wav|The lines were now very taut.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0487.wav|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0171.wav|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0423.wav|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0224.wav|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0217.wav|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0074.wav|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0305.wav|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0191.wav|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0237.wav|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0255.wav|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0348.wav|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_29-56_0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0101.wav|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0402.wav|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0276.wav|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0114.wav|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0293.wav|They were deep in the primeval forest.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0552.wav|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_253-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0384.wav|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0181.wav|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0274.wav|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0028.wav|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0184.wav|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0352.wav|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0129.wav|Her face was against his breast.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0312.wav|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0264.wav|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0092.wav|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0231.wav|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_449-476_0452.wav|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0400.wav|Manuel had one besetting sin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0152.wav|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0500.wav|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0151.wav|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0362.wav|Nope, not the slightest idea.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0475.wav|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0282.wav|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_252-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0232.wav|I cannot follow you, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0361.wav|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0491.wav|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0539.wav|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0208.wav|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0197.wav|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0273.wav|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0334.wav|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0257.wav|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0433.wav|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0420.wav|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0002.wav|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0380.wav|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0186.wav|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_477-504_0494.wav|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_29-56_0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0422.wav|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0443.wav|He was worth nothing to the world.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_421-448_0430.wav|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0497.wav|King took every advantage he knew.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0121.wav|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_169-196_0180.wav|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0199.wav|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0415.wav|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0327.wav|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
