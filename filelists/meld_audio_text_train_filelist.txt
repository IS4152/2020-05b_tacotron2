/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia426_utt6.final.wav|So  Im gonna go now.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia797_utt0.final.wav|Hi.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia436_utt5.final.wav|What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia40_utt1.final.wav|Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1007_utt13.final.wav|Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia242_utt1.final.wav|Hello Skidmark.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia147_utt4.final.wav|Nuh-uh.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia4_utt6.final.wav|Hi.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia767_utt11.final.wav|Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia549_utt8.final.wav|Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia678_utt15.final.wav|Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia182_utt1.final.wav|I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia135_utt8.final.wav|He wants to talk to you again.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia183_utt4.final.wav|Hi.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia99_utt14.final.wav|Nice to meet you too.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia111_utt4.final.wav|When? Today? Some, not a lot.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia103_utt0.final.wav|Umm, this is great wine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia845_utt9.final.wav|I like funny.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia632_utt15.final.wav|Yeah, I mean whatever.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia312_utt6.final.wav|You still love me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia973_utt7.final.wav|Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia70_utt2.final.wav|Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia975_utt1.final.wav|Hey.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia97_utt3.final.wav|That almost hit me in the face.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia174_utt4.final.wav|Actually I do have one small complaint.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia471_utt4.final.wav|Uh yes! Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia625_utt13.final.wav|I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1029_utt4.final.wav|Yeah, youre funny.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia544_utt7.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia167_utt0.final.wav|Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia541_utt1.final.wav|Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia160_utt3.final.wav|Hi, Ross.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia246_utt1.final.wav|Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia460_utt0.final.wav|Sure, now Im scared.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia571_utt2.final.wav|Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia613_utt3.final.wav|Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia938_utt0.final.wav|Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia908_utt12.final.wav|I dont know!   Yeah, I do.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia301_utt2.final.wav|Oh God...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia30_utt12.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia237_utt4.final.wav|Whoa, whoa, whoa.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1019_utt15.final.wav|Of course, sir.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia505_utt1.final.wav|I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia264_utt16.final.wav|Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia208_utt8.final.wav|We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia851_utt6.final.wav|Kristen.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia87_utt8.final.wav|We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia884_utt6.final.wav|No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia481_utt9.final.wav|No, one of them...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia205_utt6.final.wav|Oh, they're firemen guys.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia38_utt5.final.wav|No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia450_utt11.final.wav|I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia44_utt0.final.wav|And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia107_utt7.final.wav|Dear Ms. Buffay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia832_utt10.final.wav|She was totally at my mercy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia461_utt0.final.wav|Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia565_utt2.final.wav|So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia398_utt11.final.wav|Oh he's like a...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia574_utt12.final.wav|The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia853_utt6.final.wav|Phoebe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia334_utt7.final.wav|Ill talk to you tomorrow.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia332_utt8.final.wav|Tell me about it, I feel like Im holding down the fort all by myself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia940_utt0.final.wav|Oh, that is so unfortunate.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia362_utt6.final.wav|Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia201_utt8.final.wav|You are so adorable.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia741_utt2.final.wav|Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia450_utt17.final.wav|Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia771_utt15.final.wav|Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia989_utt5.final.wav|Well, we dont want that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia767_utt4.final.wav|Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia334_utt10.final.wav|I forgot my purse.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia208_utt4.final.wav|Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia195_utt4.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1015_utt1.final.wav|Hello, Mr. Bing.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1026_utt7.final.wav|I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia674_utt2.final.wav|Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia279_utt15.final.wav|Oh no, youll have to come.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia6_utt8.final.wav|I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia121_utt4.final.wav|You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia549_utt3.final.wav|Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia211_utt7.final.wav|What a sweet story.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia5_utt1.final.wav|Ameri-ccan.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia132_utt4.final.wav|Yeah, Im fine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia679_utt3.final.wav|Oh, well thank you in advance.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1019_utt4.final.wav|Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia795_utt4.final.wav|I think that would be best.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia651_utt9.final.wav|How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia245_utt7.final.wav|I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia866_utt4.final.wav|And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia739_utt2.final.wav|We have to do something with it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia793_utt1.final.wav|The bigger half.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia148_utt6.final.wav|Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia383_utt8.final.wav|Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia350_utt0.final.wav|Umm, this is nice.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia870_utt0.final.wav|This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia754_utt0.final.wav|It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia775_utt11.final.wav|The ride broke down.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia39_utt11.final.wav|Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia584_utt7.final.wav|This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia671_utt0.final.wav|Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia147_utt4.final.wav|Nuh-uh.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia324_utt5.final.wav|And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia859_utt3.final.wav|Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia977_utt14.final.wav|Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia205_utt3.final.wav|Oh, my god.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia675_utt4.final.wav|Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia328_utt5.final.wav|You take care Jill.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia190_utt6.final.wav|Im marrying her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia153_utt9.final.wav|No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia119_utt0.final.wav|I don't know.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia141_utt2.final.wav|But we really do need to find someone up here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia342_utt14.final.wav|Ill take a card.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia934_utt0.final.wav|Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia241_utt0.final.wav|Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia51_utt0.final.wav|Hey.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia980_utt0.final.wav|Dear Mary-Angela.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia184_utt0.final.wav|Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait    for your party tonight.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia892_utt5.final.wav|Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia286_utt1.final.wav|No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia31_utt1.final.wav|Well, then its not on the wall yet.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia77_utt2.final.wav|Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia96_utt4.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia184_utt20.final.wav|Yeah...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1029_utt9.final.wav|Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia596_utt4.final.wav|Joey, you know you dont actually have one.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia605_utt2.final.wav|Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia47_utt8.final.wav|All right, gimme the baby.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia350_utt7.final.wav|I know. Thanks.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia505_utt3.final.wav|Of course, of course.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia212_utt6.final.wav|Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia660_utt13.final.wav|Lets go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia597_utt3.final.wav|Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia649_utt18.final.wav|Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia179_utt9.final.wav|Yep.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia964_utt16.final.wav|Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia666_utt14.final.wav|Thanks, see you at the party.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia797_utt1.final.wav|Hey.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia530_utt16.final.wav|And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia574_utt10.final.wav|It happened in London.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia927_utt1.final.wav|What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia756_utt7.final.wav|Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia744_utt4.final.wav|Yes please.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia493_utt7.final.wav|Oh thats right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia622_utt6.final.wav|Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia243_utt1.final.wav|Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia642_utt0.final.wav|Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia782_utt5.final.wav|Oh, okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia59_utt2.final.wav|Tomorrow at 8:30.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia935_utt8.final.wav|Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia37_utt2.final.wav|Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia108_utt6.final.wav|Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia778_utt4.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia267_utt0.final.wav|Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia229_utt1.final.wav|Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia851_utt11.final.wav|Right down there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia171_utt3.final.wav|OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia23_utt6.final.wav|Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia103_utt3.final.wav|Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia939_utt7.final.wav|Im like the one who talked him into it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia337_utt18.final.wav|Great.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia57_utt2.final.wav|Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia625_utt18.final.wav|I was thinking more like a hundred.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia198_utt5.final.wav|Joey!  We should just switch.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia389_utt6.final.wav|So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia222_utt14.final.wav|Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia788_utt2.final.wav|Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia240_utt6.final.wav|Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia331_utt3.final.wav|It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1019_utt3.final.wav|Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia953_utt18.final.wav|I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia199_utt2.final.wav|Yknow, I ended up having a really good time.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia916_utt11.final.wav|Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia82_utt7.final.wav|Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia108_utt1.final.wav|Honey, both yours.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia223_utt4.final.wav|Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia271_utt0.final.wav|Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia478_utt6.final.wav|Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia817_utt9.final.wav|She didn't feel anything for him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia175_utt8.final.wav|We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia678_utt11.final.wav|Im gonna get coffee.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia195_utt8.final.wav|Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia892_utt2.final.wav|I thought you already have a job.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia446_utt1.final.wav|And youre our age. Youre our age.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia40_utt5.final.wav|Lets call em.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia508_utt15.final.wav|All right, let's try one.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia162_utt0.final.wav|I think the check in is that way.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia297_utt9.final.wav|All right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia727_utt5.final.wav|Well, you-you know what I meant.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia15_utt3.final.wav|Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia985_utt0.final.wav|Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia285_utt14.final.wav|She looks scared.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia202_utt12.final.wav|Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia55_utt7.final.wav|Like it would help.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia937_utt2.final.wav|Let us begin.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia24_utt5.final.wav|Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia414_utt11.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia324_utt6.final.wav|And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia780_utt7.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia910_utt1.final.wav|Well..
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia680_utt5.final.wav|Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1003_utt3.final.wav|I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia127_utt0.final.wav|All right buddy, time to roll over.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia410_utt3.final.wav|Fine, just stop thinking about me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia137_utt7.final.wav|That is how God intended it.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia499_utt6.final.wav|Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia116_utt5.final.wav|My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia110_utt2.final.wav|You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia522_utt5.final.wav|Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta go.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia208_utt6.final.wav|Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1016_utt11.final.wav|Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia61_utt1.final.wav|Of course, you did.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia474_utt0.final.wav|Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia306_utt7.final.wav|I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia828_utt8.final.wav|Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia156_utt3.final.wav|I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia206_utt9.final.wav|All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia524_utt2.final.wav|Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia234_utt8.final.wav|You mean they like you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia594_utt3.final.wav|Look, I just lost my other job.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia273_utt9.final.wav|Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia393_utt0.final.wav|No.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia4_utt8.final.wav|Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia539_utt6.final.wav|So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia292_utt0.final.wav|I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia177_utt3.final.wav|Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia21_utt1.final.wav|I cannot sleep in a public place.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia145_utt10.final.wav|Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia455_utt13.final.wav|Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia205_utt2.final.wav|I'll even let you ring the bell.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1007_utt14.final.wav|Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia129_utt7.final.wav|Uh, de-clawing cats.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia931_utt0.final.wav|I know you botched that operation on purpose.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia342_utt17.final.wav|This game is kinda fun.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia15_utt21.final.wav|And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia486_utt16.final.wav|Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia32_utt3.final.wav|Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia589_utt10.final.wav|I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia232_utt4.final.wav|Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia199_utt11.final.wav|Ahh, to be 13 again.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia26_utt9.final.wav|Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia849_utt5.final.wav|Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia823_utt2.final.wav|Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia514_utt3.final.wav|No you answer it and take pledges.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia897_utt0.final.wav|Oh, but its made her so happy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia94_utt7.final.wav|I dont want to lose you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia210_utt8.final.wav|Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia759_utt11.final.wav|Chelsea.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia265_utt1.final.wav|He might still show up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia167_utt6.final.wav|Look at you. All jealous.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia72_utt7.final.wav|All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia450_utt6.final.wav|Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia20_utt11.final.wav|Yeah, that really calms me down.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia918_utt0.final.wav|Drum roll.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia449_utt10.final.wav|Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia544_utt3.final.wav|Oh.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia147_utt3.final.wav|It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia130_utt15.final.wav|Yeah, okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia478_utt5.final.wav|Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1036_utt7.final.wav|It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia793_utt4.final.wav|I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia506_utt3.final.wav|Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia331_utt4.final.wav|Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia904_utt2.final.wav|A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia905_utt8.final.wav|No way, forget it.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia886_utt21.final.wav|No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia317_utt13.final.wav|When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia314_utt0.final.wav|Isnt it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin married.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia13_utt2.final.wav|Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia449_utt5.final.wav|Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia423_utt7.final.wav|I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia456_utt10.final.wav|Maybe it was the guy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia908_utt0.final.wav|Shh! Get me out of here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia789_utt1.final.wav|Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia249_utt2.final.wav|Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia483_utt0.final.wav|Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia252_utt1.final.wav|Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia893_utt8.final.wav|So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia47_utt1.final.wav|It's gonna be worth it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia782_utt8.final.wav|But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia571_utt9.final.wav|Thread the needle.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia176_utt1.final.wav|That little naked guy would be me.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia608_utt3.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia277_utt4.final.wav|But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia89_utt1.final.wav|Its 6:00.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia235_utt6.final.wav|I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia226_utt2.final.wav|Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia421_utt2.final.wav|I can tell her how I feel.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia86_utt2.final.wav|I thought you didn't smoke.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia864_utt2.final.wav|But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia156_utt11.final.wav|Hey Rach.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia468_utt8.final.wav|Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia681_utt2.final.wav|Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia569_utt2.final.wav|No, let's just leave the lights on.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia309_utt4.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia632_utt13.final.wav|Sure.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia41_utt13.final.wav|Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia784_utt0.final.wav|Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia932_utt11.final.wav|Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia168_utt3.final.wav|A beard and a moustache.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia234_utt3.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia207_utt4.final.wav|Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia424_utt3.final.wav|Not her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia0_utt8.final.wav|Good to know.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia206_utt13.final.wav|I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia246_utt0.final.wav|Thank you so much for coming back over.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia530_utt5.final.wav|I took this picture from your fridge.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1038_utt5.final.wav|They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia727_utt1.final.wav|I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia236_utt13.final.wav|Good choice.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia21_utt1.final.wav|I cannot sleep in a public place.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia367_utt5.final.wav|Uh,  wow, 700.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia818_utt7.final.wav|Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia245_utt1.final.wav|We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia950_utt16.final.wav|Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia638_utt7.final.wav|Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia240_utt1.final.wav|Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia527_utt6.final.wav|We have one.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia767_utt0.final.wav|Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia97_utt3.final.wav|That almost hit me in the face.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia97_utt2.final.wav|Here you go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia508_utt21.final.wav|Y'know what? We need to move on.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia674_utt5.final.wav|That's alright, I'll take it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia932_utt5.final.wav|No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia211_utt0.final.wav|So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia123_utt8.final.wav|You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia799_utt4.final.wav|My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia135_utt2.final.wav|I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia828_utt13.final.wav|No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia18_utt6.final.wav|Uh-oh.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1038_utt12.final.wav|It made me nuts.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia49_utt2.final.wav|Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1021_utt0.final.wav|I can blow dry it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia151_utt0.final.wav|Okay! So, well just stay married.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia223_utt5.final.wav|Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia799_utt1.final.wav|Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia10_utt5.final.wav|No.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia596_utt1.final.wav|That is true.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia55_utt0.final.wav|I had a really nice time tonight.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia336_utt7.final.wav|No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia393_utt1.final.wav|Youll see.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia34_utt7.final.wav|Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia736_utt7.final.wav|Wait uh, listen.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia206_utt4.final.wav|Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia530_utt18.final.wav|But umm, youre right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia263_utt2.final.wav|Go for it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia848_utt2.final.wav|Rach, I got a message from you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia148_utt14.final.wav|I'm not moving out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia128_utt1.final.wav|Yes.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia840_utt5.final.wav|Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1032_utt9.final.wav|Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia6_utt5.final.wav|Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia192_utt2.final.wav|Her dying wish was for one last kiss.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia672_utt4.final.wav|Well, I wanted to be thorough.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia179_utt12.final.wav|I wont speed.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia523_utt14.final.wav|Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1_utt5.final.wav|All right, well...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia508_utt4.final.wav|Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia607_utt3.final.wav|The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia622_utt5.final.wav|I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia49_utt0.final.wav|Well, not really.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia561_utt1.final.wav|So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1025_utt17.final.wav|Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia6_utt5.final.wav|Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia244_utt5.final.wav|Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia182_utt10.final.wav|Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia355_utt2.final.wav|Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia787_utt0.final.wav|Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia93_utt4.final.wav|Excellent hole, Joe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia992_utt7.final.wav|Basically we just feel that he's...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia741_utt0.final.wav|Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia992_utt5.final.wav|Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia956_utt1.final.wav|Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia194_utt1.final.wav|Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia255_utt10.final.wav|Well,fall out of it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia129_utt2.final.wav|By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia407_utt6.final.wav|Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia100_utt2.final.wav|You can take it off.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia32_utt5.final.wav|Uma Thurman.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia623_utt15.final.wav|That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia947_utt10.final.wav|Okay, go ahead.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia509_utt2.final.wav|Give her some money.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia608_utt9.final.wav|Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia403_utt0.final.wav|Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont want to miss when they were skinny.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia106_utt5.final.wav|Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia145_utt15.final.wav|Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia9_utt1.final.wav|Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia53_utt2.final.wav|Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia347_utt4.final.wav|Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1001_utt3.final.wav|It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia11_utt2.final.wav|Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia198_utt2.final.wav|Left!  Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia795_utt2.final.wav|We fell asleep! That is all.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia693_utt2.final.wav|Ive been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I dont need this grief.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia117_utt0.final.wav|Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia29_utt6.final.wav|Chandler, we have talked about this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia56_utt0.final.wav|Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia74_utt0.final.wav|Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia186_utt0.final.wav|I really like waking up with you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia908_utt10.final.wav|Right-right up here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia110_utt3.final.wav|That and arrogance.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia657_utt4.final.wav|Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1004_utt1.final.wav|Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia599_utt8.final.wav|Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1022_utt5.final.wav|Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia553_utt19.final.wav|No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia342_utt11.final.wav|You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia777_utt9.final.wav|Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia82_utt0.final.wav|Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia47_utt12.final.wav|Hello.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia279_utt2.final.wav|Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia999_utt4.final.wav|But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia690_utt1.final.wav|Its so good.  Oh, thanks.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia217_utt0.final.wav|Whatever.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia73_utt2.final.wav|Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia939_utt8.final.wav|I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia488_utt1.final.wav|I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia249_utt1.final.wav|Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia990_utt13.final.wav|You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia890_utt3.final.wav|Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia945_utt2.final.wav|Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia11_utt2.final.wav|Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1009_utt0.final.wav|I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia168_utt7.final.wav|Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia706_utt3.final.wav|It's your timer.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia401_utt12.final.wav|Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! Theres Frank.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia58_utt1.final.wav|Uh-huh.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia116_utt5.final.wav|My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia82_utt5.final.wav|Its not like we run in the same circles.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia68_utt1.final.wav|Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia354_utt3.final.wav|All right, bye-bye.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia123_utt9.final.wav|I don't have a page.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia222_utt4.final.wav|I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia145_utt10.final.wav|Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia626_utt8.final.wav|Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia952_utt2.final.wav|Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia231_utt10.final.wav|Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia857_utt10.final.wav|But, well stay here with you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia240_utt4.final.wav|Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia342_utt8.final.wav|Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia630_utt4.final.wav|Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1021_utt1.final.wav|I can put gel on it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia905_utt2.final.wav|Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia401_utt4.final.wav|Ah, oh, hang on a second.  Come in, come in.  All right, so think about it, and call me back.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia507_utt16.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia137_utt3.final.wav|And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia592_utt10.final.wav|He obviously lost his mind.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia508_utt10.final.wav|Hmm, noodle soup.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia106_utt4.final.wav|Just tell me how.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia496_utt12.final.wav|No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia202_utt2.final.wav|Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia34_utt4.final.wav|I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia844_utt11.final.wav|Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia145_utt6.final.wav|I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia108_utt4.final.wav|Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia110_utt2.final.wav|You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia264_utt18.final.wav|Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia558_utt5.final.wav|Ummmmmmmm, no.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia303_utt1.final.wav|No, that is what the game is.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia984_utt2.final.wav|Yeah, I've been around.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia451_utt6.final.wav|You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia158_utt1.final.wav|It cant be me, Im standing right here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia11_utt4.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia518_utt5.final.wav|You look at me, and nothin.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia620_utt0.final.wav|And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia459_utt0.final.wav|Oh that's an eye removal machine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia553_utt11.final.wav|Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia184_utt6.final.wav|Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia231_utt5.final.wav|Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia423_utt2.final.wav|He's uh, he's in a whole other place.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia689_utt5.final.wav|Chip, is Chip Matthews.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia182_utt12.final.wav|You're right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia149_utt1.final.wav|Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia862_utt0.final.wav|Maybe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia103_utt4.final.wav|I studied for a year in Barcelona.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia523_utt1.final.wav|I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia234_utt9.final.wav|Maybe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia49_utt9.final.wav|Joey that is so sweet.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia424_utt6.final.wav|But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia428_utt1.final.wav|I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia189_utt3.final.wav|That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia40_utt10.final.wav|Here you go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia639_utt0.final.wav|Ok, got the vent open.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia316_utt0.final.wav|Hello.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia576_utt6.final.wav|Heads it is.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia860_utt10.final.wav|Theyre wildly unpopular.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia871_utt6.final.wav|And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia16_utt5.final.wav|Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia655_utt5.final.wav|I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia319_utt17.final.wav|And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia410_utt7.final.wav|Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia331_utt7.final.wav|Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia561_utt18.final.wav|Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia961_utt12.final.wav|That's okay, Joe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia195_utt10.final.wav|Yeah, maybe.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia0_utt0.final.wav|also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia517_utt6.final.wav|Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia138_utt5.final.wav|Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia735_utt2.final.wav|You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we havent actually met...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia803_utt3.final.wav|Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia69_utt2.final.wav|No, no, I'm still working on mine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia918_utt6.final.wav|Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia185_utt8.final.wav|Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia76_utt3.final.wav|I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia962_utt4.final.wav|Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia28_utt4.final.wav|I think youve got concussion.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia473_utt1.final.wav|I already fed her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia111_utt7.final.wav|Dont worry about that man, that happens.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia902_utt16.final.wav|Oh-ho, I think its nice.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia720_utt14.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia388_utt5.final.wav|I highly doubt that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia901_utt5.final.wav|Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia913_utt10.final.wav|All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia976_utt6.final.wav|Her name is Stephanie... something.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia930_utt15.final.wav|What are you talking about? Bitch.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia565_utt1.final.wav|Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia536_utt2.final.wav|Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia707_utt5.final.wav|Not interested in that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia367_utt14.final.wav|Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia342_utt3.final.wav|Its possible, they have really sharp edges.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia730_utt4.final.wav|Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia839_utt5.final.wav|Yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia657_utt14.final.wav|Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia457_utt11.final.wav|All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia531_utt11.final.wav|Obviously, I screwed up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia124_utt3.final.wav|So, rocks.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia907_utt4.final.wav|I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1001_utt5.final.wav|Fortunately, it is me.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia797_utt6.final.wav|I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia844_utt7.final.wav|Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia996_utt6.final.wav|I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia94_utt1.final.wav|Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia107_utt1.final.wav|Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia167_utt6.final.wav|Look at you. All jealous.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia945_utt8.final.wav|Its not funny, this is actually my job.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia856_utt4.final.wav|Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia159_utt6.final.wav|Oh, I know...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia774_utt7.final.wav|Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia973_utt18.final.wav|Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia990_utt8.final.wav|Hey, you're not him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia639_utt8.final.wav|Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia171_utt2.final.wav|OK.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia361_utt4.final.wav|Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia189_utt10.final.wav|I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia796_utt9.final.wav|I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia224_utt1.final.wav|It's Jake.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia239_utt0.final.wav|So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia853_utt0.final.wav|By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia81_utt16.final.wav|Looks like I was second to last.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia98_utt1.final.wav|Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia947_utt3.final.wav|I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia851_utt16.final.wav|Oh I, I have plans tonight.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia116_utt4.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia670_utt15.final.wav|They've arrested Monica.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia658_utt10.final.wav|I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia979_utt5.final.wav|Well actually, Ross doesn't.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia47_utt8.final.wav|All right, gimme the baby.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia559_utt5.final.wav|Never had that dream.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia841_utt0.final.wav|Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia302_utt10.final.wav|Okay, listen Robert...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia792_utt9.final.wav|Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia116_utt1.final.wav|I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia910_utt14.final.wav|I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia183_utt14.final.wav|I missed you.  I'm gonna get changed.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia27_utt0.final.wav|Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia939_utt18.final.wav|I guess so.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia809_utt8.final.wav|Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia638_utt3.final.wav|Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia62_utt9.final.wav|Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia895_utt9.final.wav|Hurry up.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia392_utt12.final.wav|All right, the seven of us miss you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia714_utt5.final.wav|See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia302_utt6.final.wav|Hey.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia504_utt0.final.wav|Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia49_utt8.final.wav|Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia148_utt18.final.wav|It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia670_utt2.final.wav|Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia95_utt8.final.wav|You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia853_utt13.final.wav|Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia26_utt8.final.wav|Actually, that can't happen.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia607_utt13.final.wav|God, he's good.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia551_utt3.final.wav|But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia727_utt6.final.wav|No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia673_utt10.final.wav|This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia51_utt3.final.wav|I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia47_utt9.final.wav|No, I got him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia775_utt1.final.wav|OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia597_utt6.final.wav|Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia120_utt8.final.wav|Okay.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia772_utt14.final.wav|Umm, I am free tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia964_utt15.final.wav|Sorry. Sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia311_utt11.final.wav|And also, we dont know what to do with this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia518_utt6.final.wav|Nothing.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia435_utt8.final.wav|And also, congratulations on your wedding.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia813_utt9.final.wav|Hello darling.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia621_utt5.final.wav|Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia844_utt0.final.wav|Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia326_utt8.final.wav|Ah, its still not the time.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia34_utt12.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia450_utt2.final.wav|Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia177_utt7.final.wav|I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia308_utt0.final.wav|So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia718_utt6.final.wav|Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia434_utt0.final.wav|Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia164_utt3.final.wav|I did.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia29_utt0.final.wav|Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia953_utt17.final.wav|Better think of a new name for him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia11_utt4.final.wav|Thank you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia475_utt5.final.wav|They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia794_utt6.final.wav|Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia3_utt4.final.wav|Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia429_utt6.final.wav|She's checking the coats.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia148_utt16.final.wav|Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia356_utt16.final.wav|I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia445_utt12.final.wav|Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia253_utt10.final.wav|I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia707_utt15.final.wav|Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia23_utt3.final.wav|I mean thats unbelievable.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia720_utt5.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia960_utt9.final.wav|Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia650_utt5.final.wav|Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia69_utt4.final.wav|Yeah, it was really hard.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia408_utt0.final.wav|Ah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia112_utt4.final.wav|The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia264_utt1.final.wav|Chandler. I sensed it was you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia464_utt19.final.wav|Thats why its so funny.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia665_utt1.final.wav|Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia28_utt4.final.wav|I think youve got concussion.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia87_utt3.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia941_utt11.final.wav|Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia848_utt4.final.wav|Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia186_utt1.final.wav|I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia811_utt5.final.wav|Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia441_utt2.final.wav|Oh, its okay.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia49_utt2.final.wav|Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia635_utt3.final.wav|Just act like you belong.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia850_utt2.final.wav|I have to be up in seven minutes.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia137_utt6.final.wav|I mean, this-this looks so great.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia38_utt6.final.wav|Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia266_utt0.final.wav|Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia89_utt15.final.wav|And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia772_utt8.final.wav|Oh Drake.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia440_utt8.final.wav|Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia122_utt2.final.wav|Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia592_utt6.final.wav|Hold on.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia776_utt5.final.wav|You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia199_utt3.final.wav|Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia97_utt3.final.wav|That almost hit me in the face.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia819_utt2.final.wav|Hey sweetie.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia229_utt2.final.wav|Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia910_utt6.final.wav|He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia477_utt12.final.wav|Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia459_utt6.final.wav|Uh-huh.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia928_utt3.final.wav|I missed this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1038_utt3.final.wav|I broke up with her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia125_utt2.final.wav|Ohh, its time to go.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia456_utt1.final.wav|Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia175_utt9.final.wav|I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia157_utt0.final.wav|Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia693_utt1.final.wav|: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia241_utt11.final.wav|Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia736_utt6.final.wav|Well, that me.  Here, have this.  Im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia72_utt2.final.wav|Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia686_utt6.final.wav|Youre right, Im sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia246_utt5.final.wav|Focus.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia269_utt0.final.wav|Its actually going to be just family.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1026_utt12.final.wav|I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia235_utt5.final.wav|I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia632_utt5.final.wav|Its-its so  inappropriate.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia279_utt2.final.wav|Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia947_utt15.final.wav|Okay.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia321_utt8.final.wav|We didnt have sex.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1035_utt2.final.wav|I cant believe youre not picking me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia42_utt1.final.wav|Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia117_utt2.final.wav|No, I just I think that its too soon.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia65_utt0.final.wav|See, I see.... big passion in your future.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia507_utt5.final.wav|Just a touch.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia273_utt8.final.wav|Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia222_utt8.final.wav|So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia204_utt11.final.wav|I, um...
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia759_utt1.final.wav|No. Not anymore.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia174_utt4.final.wav|Actually I do have one small complaint.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia266_utt0.final.wav|Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia874_utt4.final.wav|Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia901_utt1.final.wav|Id really prefer a mountain bike.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia441_utt1.final.wav|I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia869_utt6.final.wav|Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia977_utt10.final.wav|Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia370_utt0.final.wav|Really Mr. Geller, you dont have to do this.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia119_utt4.final.wav|Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia249_utt2.final.wav|Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia26_utt11.final.wav|Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia37_utt0.final.wav|Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1038_utt6.final.wav|Come on, they were not that huge.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia252_utt13.final.wav|Otherwise it's just cruel.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia74_utt3.final.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia499_utt2.final.wav|Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia674_utt7.final.wav|This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia755_utt8.final.wav|Not nice enough.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia53_utt6.final.wav|Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia248_utt6.final.wav|Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia851_utt0.final.wav|Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia241_utt2.final.wav|I asked him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1003_utt2.final.wav|This place is really my Grandmothers.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia196_utt0.final.wav|Okay, that's, that's enough.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia156_utt3.final.wav|I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia195_utt13.final.wav|Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia49_utt0.final.wav|Well, not really.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia336_utt10.final.wav|Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia775_utt12.final.wav|So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia720_utt18.final.wav|Okay, so he's out of here.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia842_utt1.final.wav|Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia319_utt2.final.wav|So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia179_utt2.final.wav|I bet youre a Gemini.
