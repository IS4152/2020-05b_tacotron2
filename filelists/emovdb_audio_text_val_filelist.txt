/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0559.wav|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0254.wav|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0015.wav|It's the aurora borealis.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0104.wav|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0280.wav|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0156.wav|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0162.wav|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0207.wav|How much was it.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0179.wav|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0345.wav|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_85-94_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_141-168_0149.wav|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0225.wav|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_29-56_0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0531.wav|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0122.wav|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_169_196_0192.wav|He did not rush in.
