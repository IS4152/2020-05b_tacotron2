/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0268.wav|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_225_252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0459.wav|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0079.wav|It was a large canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0432.wav|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0120.wav|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0527.wav|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0451.wav|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_197-224_0218.wav|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0012.wav|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0220.wav|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_367-392_0373.wav|Points of view, new ideas, life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0448.wav|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0315.wav|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0194.wav|He drank of the water cautiously.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0261.wav|I have been doubly baptized.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0165.wav|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_141-168_0144.wav|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0481.wav|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0190.wav|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0480.wav|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_367-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0308.wav|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0006.wav|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0173.wav|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0350.wav|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0355.wav|A burst of laughter was his reward.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_225-252_0251.wav|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0416.wav|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0512.wav|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_449-476_0467.wav|And so early in the voyage, too.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_309-336_0326.wav|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0060.wav|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0030.wav|I had faith in them.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0343.wav|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/amused/amused_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0228.wav|But it contributed to the smash.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0364.wav|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0143.wav|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0169.wav|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0457.wav|What I saw I could not at first believe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_57-84_0082.wav|His face was streaming with blood.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_85-112_0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0271.wav|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0127.wav|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0329.wav|Ah, indeed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0106.wav|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0409.wav|He could feel a new stir in the land.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_225_252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0477.wav|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_421-448_0440.wav|Yes, sir, I corrected.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0240.wav|Wash your hands of me.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0211.wav|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0226.wav|That came before my A B C's.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0236.wav|Don't you see I hate you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_281-307_0298.wav|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0223.wav|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_369-392_0388.wav|It was my idea to a tee.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0133.wav|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0314.wav|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0279.wav|She said with chattering teeth.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0442.wav|You live on an income which your father earned.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0297.wav|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0164.wav|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_141-168_0158.wav|Does that look good.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_am/amused_421-448_0434.wav|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_am/amused_113-140_0136.wav|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0124.wav|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0135.wav|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0392.wav|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0098.wav|Shall I carry you.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0174.wav|They were the presage of storm.
