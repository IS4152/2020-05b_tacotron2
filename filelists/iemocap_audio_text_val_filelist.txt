/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M016.wav|You know.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_M001.wav|Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro07/Ses01F_impro07_F008.wav|Umm. It's...It's uhh...It's Critical Studies. It's a really prestigious program, so they say.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro07/Ses01M_impro07_F014.wav|Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_M012.wav|What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M007.wav|You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_F004.wav|Where?  Who?  What are you talking about?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F000.wav|What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M013.wav|This is stupid.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_M013.wav|Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_F019.wav|How exciting. You should have a wedding on the beach.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_M014.wav|Party. You want to get drunk tonight?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro06/Ses05F_impro06_F017.wav|Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M023.wav|God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F017.wav|Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F012.wav|Very Midsummer Night's wedding.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F035.wav|Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F017.wav|Yeah. I mean, I get a call-back and stuff, but-
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F008.wav|He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08b/Ses03M_impro08b_F016.wav|Really?  No contract?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M039.wav|I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_M006.wav|What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M033.wav|We weren't in a good spot.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M026.wav|You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I propose I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road, we will end up on a beach arguing over fish. You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_F015.wav|Augie.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F002.wav|I mean, nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M053.wav|No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F003.wav|Oh, what, how- where how did you do it?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F001.wav|What flashlight?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F010.wav|a part left than I can do.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F037.wav|Yeah, we all have to hang out now.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F020.wav|Elliott, worms don't pop.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro05/Ses02F_impro05_M016.wav|Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F012.wav|She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_F009.wav|No thanks.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F013.wav|Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M008.wav|But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M022.wav|Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_M012.wav|It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M018.wav|You felt something that far back?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_M039.wav|Oh that's great. My mom said we can move in with her again if we run out of money.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F015.wav|I don't know. I don't know anything other than this, though, is the problem. This is my life. This is what I built everything about, you know.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M017.wav|Ah, that reply has broken my heart.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M036.wav|I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro06/Ses03F_impro06_F019.wav|Not very good.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_F012.wav|Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F028.wav|I just want something to turn out like I expected it to.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_F000.wav|Why did you invite her here?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F022.wav|Not like that, you're not.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M023.wav|I don't know.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_F014.wav|Hi.   You know...
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_M011.wav|What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_F001.wav|Freda is the only one who knows we're up here, and she wouldn't call up.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_F007.wav|How long do you have to go for?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_M010.wav|and everything like but
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M004.wav|Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M042.wav|Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M053.wav|You have a wonderful day.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F028.wav|I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08b/Ses03M_impro08b_M002.wav|I know I just need to verify every time.  I'm sorry.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F012.wav|I just don't.  It's stupid.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M035.wav|I'm doing the best I can.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F048.wav|At least we won't need glasses.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F018.wav|That's serious enough.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_F013.wav|Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_M006.wav|I guess they can do it,
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_M009.wav|Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_M007.wav|Oh, wow. You got in?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M011.wav|So he's gone forever then?  You sure?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_M017.wav|Really? Penny slots?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_2/Ses01F_script01_2_F014.wav|I can't help it.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M002.wav|I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F009.wav|No thanks.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F024.wav|I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M046.wav|Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M014.wav|I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M040.wav|Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F006.wav|We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_F011.wav|Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_M013.wav|We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F019.wav|I think you are talking nonsense.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F007.wav|We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M009.wav|And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M013.wav|You needn't be so grand just because don't happen want any yourself right now.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F003.wav|I don't think so.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M008.wav|That's a nice point of view, I must say.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_F027.wav|Yeah.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro02/Ses04F_impro02_F001.wav|I know.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F010.wav|I--I guess this is why I came.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F002.wav|It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F019.wav|What is it?  Even in your letters, there is something ashamed.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F012.wav|The pity is that one can't stay happy.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F025.wav|Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M028.wav|All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F021.wav|And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F027.wav|I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_M009.wav|Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M019.wav|Right.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F026.wav|It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F000.wav|I have something to tell you.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F002.wav|Well what are we going to do?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F035.wav|All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_M001.wav|Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M018.wav|Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M003.wav|It must be them then.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M018.wav|Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F042.wav|You, You are too much, I can't handle it.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_M002.wav|[LAUGHTER] Guess who just got hitched?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_M002.wav|um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M026.wav|You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M028.wav|Line?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_M007.wav|Well I'm looking at these.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M038.wav|No I'll do no such thing.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_M013.wav|Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_M015.wav|There are a lot of people calling us having problems.  Every phone company is having the same problems ma'am

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M038.wav|Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F002.wav|Don't look at my left hand.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F049.wav|Or not.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_F004.wav|How can they do that?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F005.wav|You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_M014.wav|Really, Amanda.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F030.wav|I didn't say that.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F034.wav|That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M052.wav|No?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M040.wav|because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F029.wav|This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_F027.wav|I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_F015.wav|if I call it up on the screen.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M031.wav|Hah.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F014.wav|Law school? Maybe.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M007.wav|It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_F041.wav|Beast; brute; cad; whore
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M007.wav|Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_F001.wav|Presents?  A trivial little broach.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F026.wav|You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_F018.wav|I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M028.wav|Exactly, yeah.  I can't believe you met him in Africa.

/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M026.wav|but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M026.wav|Because that would just really be a topper for me.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F021.wav|So you're just going to take care of this for me?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M013.wav|I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro01/Ses01F_impro01_M009.wav|A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M023.wav|It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?
/temp/e-liang/IEMOCAP_full_release/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M059.wav|So now, I'm going to have to find somebody else to bear my children.
