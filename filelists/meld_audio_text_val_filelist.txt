/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia81_utt2.final.wav|He's planning your birthday party.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia190_utt5.final.wav|Yknow, we dont have to imagine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia686_utt4.final.wav|Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia109_utt7.final.wav|I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia69_utt2.final.wav|No, no, I'm still working on mine.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia469_utt1.final.wav|Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia6_utt15.final.wav|Im sorry.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia973_utt14.final.wav|All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia956_utt11.final.wav|I think this can go somewhere.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia237_utt6.final.wav|Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia531_utt4.final.wav|Im from Long Island.

/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/dev_splits_complete/dia30_utt11.final.wav|Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia422_utt5.final.wav|Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia275_utt9.final.wav|Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/train_splits/dia1016_utt21.final.wav|Yeah, youre right.
/temp/e-liang/MELD.Raw/output_repeated_splits_test/dia49_utt3.final.wav|Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
