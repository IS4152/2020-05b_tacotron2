/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0001.wav|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0398.wav|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0130.wav|She was his now, forever.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0357.wav|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_113-140_0134.wav|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_336-364_0338.wav|The fighting had now become intermittent.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0116.wav|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0490.wav|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0425.wav|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_85-112_0111.wav|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_169-196_0183.wav|And the air was growing chilly.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_337-364_0342.wav|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_29-56_0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0552.wav|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0004.wav|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_57-84_0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0358.wav|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0063.wav|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0248.wav|I had been sad too long already.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0209.wav|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0371.wav|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253_280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_113-140_0113.wav|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_141-168_0141.wav|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_309-336_0324.wav|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_449-476_0450.wav|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0140.wav|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0518.wav|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0304.wav|I graduated last of my class.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_1-28_0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0366.wav|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0234.wav|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_393-420_0410.wav|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_57-84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0246.wav|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0277.wav|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0103.wav|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_141-168_0157.wav|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0029.wav|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_449-476_0461.wav|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0245.wav|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0216.wav|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_169-196_0170.wav|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0247.wav|They ought to pass here some time today.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0372.wav|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0344.wav|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0250.wav|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0081.wav|What if she did not come to the rock.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0108.wav|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_253-280_0262.wav|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0390.wav|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/Neutral_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_309-336_0318.wav|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0256.wav|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0038.wav|We'll have to watch our chances.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0089.wav|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0294.wav|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_197-224_0202.wav|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0210.wav|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_367-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113-140_0115.wav|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0341.wav|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0462.wav|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
/temp/e-liang/out/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169_196_0177.wav|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
/temp/e-liang/out/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0123.wav|She had died from cold and starvation.
/temp/e-liang/out/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/temp/e-liang/out/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0301.wav|But all my dreams violated this law.
