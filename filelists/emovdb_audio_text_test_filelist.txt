/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0075.wav|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_197-224_0222.wav|What part of the United States is your home.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0102.wav|He will follow us soon.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_74_84_0076.wav|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_85-112_0109.wav|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_336-364_0353.wav|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0150.wav|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0207.wav|How much was it.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0508.wav|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0445.wav|The creative joy, I murmured.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_85-112_0107.wav|If you only could know how I thank you.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0147.wav|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0399.wav|And here's another idea.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_253-280_0265.wav|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_337-360_0349.wav|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_365-392_0369.wav|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_57-84_0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_169-196_0182.wav|This time he did not yap for mercy.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_113-140_0131.wav|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0175.wav|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0300.wav|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_253-280_0258.wav|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_505-532_0515.wav|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_309-336_0331.wav|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_113_140_0125.wav|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_29-56_0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_253-280_0263.wav|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0397.wav|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_281-308_0284.wav|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_197-364_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0267.wav|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0453.wav|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_113-136_0118.wav|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0295.wav|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0496.wav|And Tom King patiently endured.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_367-392_0391.wav|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_29-45_0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0259.wav|Think of investing in such an adventure.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0146.wav|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_281-308_0306.wav|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0241.wav|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_169-190_0189.wav|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0485.wav|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0285.wav|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_57-84_0057.wav|I have no idea, replied Philip.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_29-56_0046.wav|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_253-280_0270.wav|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_309-336_0319.wav|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_336-364_0359.wav|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0289.wav|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_57-84_0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0303.wav|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_169-196_0178.wav|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_1-28_0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0437.wav|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0286.wav|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_225-252_0235.wav|His voice was passionately rebellious.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0393.wav|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_281-308_0287.wav|Keep an eye on him.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_169-196_0154.wav|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0153.wav|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_197-224_0213.wav|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_477-504_0483.wav|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0299.wav|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0368.wav|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_309-336_0321.wav|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_281-308_0283.wav|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_281-308_0302.wav|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_533-560_0544.wav|He may anticipate the day of his death.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0389.wav|Mab, she said.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_225-252_0243.wav|I only read the quotations.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0266.wav|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_95-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_85-112_0105.wav|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_337-364_0354.wav|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_477-504_0492.wav|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_225_252_0239.wav|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_253-280_0269.wav|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_57-84_0077.wav|It is the fire, partly, she said.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_141_168_0145.wav|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_57-84_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_393-420_0418.wav|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_disgust/disgust_253-280_0253.wav|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_365-392_0375.wav|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_1-28_0008.wav|Gad, your letter came just in time.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_337-364_0356.wav|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_225-252_0249.wav|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_367-392_0377.wav|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_85-112_0087.wav|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_393-420_0406.wav|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0424.wav|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_336-364_0351.wav|It was more like sugar.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0278.wav|It would give me nervous prostration.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_477-504_0499.wav|And right there I saw and knew it all.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_am/amused_85-112_0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_449-476_0472.wav|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0431.wav|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_281-308_0288.wav|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0463.wav|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_141-168_0142.wav|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_sleep/sleepiness_169-196_0187.wav|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0014.wav|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_1-28_0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_421-448_0438.wav|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_477-504_0504.wav|He was an athlete and a giant.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_29-56_0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/amused/amused_141_168_0159.wav|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_253-280_0260.wav|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_393-420_0419.wav|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_309-336_0322.wav|This is a common experience with all of us.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_1-28_0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_anger/anger_421-448_0429.wav|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_neut/neutral_197_224_0214.wav|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0041.wav|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_141-168_0166.wav|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_421-448_0421.wav|By golly, the boy wins.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_sleep/sleepiness_225-252_0244.wav|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/sleepiness/sleepiness_1-28_0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_85-112_0112.wav|He was wounded in the arm.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_421-448_0436.wav|But Martin smiled a superior smile.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_sleep/sleepiness_29-56_0035.wav|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_1-28_0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_am/amused_449-476_0476.wav|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_141-168_0163.wav|Philip made no effort to follow.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_anger/anger_197-224_0215.wav|They die out of spite.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/jenie/aud_neutral/neutral_113-140_0119.wav|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/Disgust_85-112_0110.wav|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_neut/neutral_141-168_0161.wav|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/sam/aud_disgust/disgust_449-476_0470.wav|He spat it out like so much venom.

/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/neutral/neutral_197-224_0201.wav|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/josh/aud_am/amused_57-73_0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
/home/e/e-liang/is4152/emovdb/bea/anger/anger_197-224_0221.wav|I don't know why you're here at all.
